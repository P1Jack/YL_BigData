flowers
The responses of the aesthetes formed
a frightening flow in the story
From February 28 to April 2
many of them had strange, bizarre flows
and their brightness increased immensely
during the period, flowing
when the sculptor was delirious
About one-fourth of those
who agreed to tell about their flow experiences
reported landscapes and echoes
very similar to Wilcox's descriptions
